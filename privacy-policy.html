    <h1>Privacy Policy for RopoSort Chrome Extension</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date: October 2, 2024</strong></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Thank you for using the <strong>RopoSort</strong> Chrome extension. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how RopoSort collects, uses, and protects any information you may provide while using the extension.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>RopoSort</strong> does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data from users. The extension only interacts with product data that is publicly available on the RoposoClout website to enable sorting functionality. We do not collect, log, or share any personally identifiable information (PII).</p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>To function properly, <strong>RopoSort</strong> requests the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>ActiveTab and Host Permissions (https://app.roposoclout.com/)</strong>: These permissions allow the extension to interact with the RoposoClout website, access product listings, and apply sorting preferences (e.g., by price or delivery ratio). No information is transmitted outside of your browser.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage</strong>: This is used to store user preferences locally on your device (such as sorting options). The data remains within your browser and is not sent to any external servers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Usage</h2>
    <p><strong>Product Sorting</strong>: The extension only uses the product information available on the RoposoClout website. This data is used exclusively to allow you to sort and organize products according to your preferences.</p>
    <p><strong>No Tracking</strong>: RopoSort does not track or analyze your browsing behavior on any websites, including RoposoClout.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Access</h2>
    <p>RopoSort does not share any data with third parties. All actions performed by the extension happen locally within your browser.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We prioritize protecting your privacy and data. Since no personal information is collected or transmitted, there is no risk of exposure to third parties. The extension interacts solely with the public data available on the RoposoClout platform to perform its sorting functionality.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the "Effective Date" at the top of the policy will be updated accordingly.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or the extensionâ€™s use of permissions, feel free to contact us at [your email address].</p>
